Inspired by Kensuke Koike's pasta cutter work (wich can be found [on his instagram account](https://www.instagram.com/p/CvKmUCfIeYJ/))

Simple python script where the user decides the resolution (number of strips to cut width-wise) and of course, the image!

Can be used for fun or when you only took one picture but really wished you took four wierd looking pictures instead 📸

Demonstration with a monkey and 89 strips width-wise
